# From Scratch

I'd really love to write an open source site generator. I'm dissatisfied with the ones that are available for a myriad of reasons I can't really explain now, and I thought it would be a great code practice to build a site completely statically with HTML/CSS/JS, and then build the architecture around it to be able to generate and serve it instead. I intend to blog the experience as I go.
