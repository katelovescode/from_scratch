  <body><h2>Building Architecture</h2>

<h3>July 11th, 2019</h3>

<p>I created a posts folder to start storing posts away from the main page content. I don&#39;t like that Jekyll has posts in a directory and pages scattered in the root; I&#39;d much rather build a cleaner directory to organize my stuff. I&#39;m also already bored with writing in raw HTML format, which I probably could have predicted. ðŸ˜‚ I think my next step is to move to markdown after I&#39;ve figured out the right way to include post html in, say a list of posts. I&#39;m like one step in and it&#39;s time to start working on/in Javascript.</p>
