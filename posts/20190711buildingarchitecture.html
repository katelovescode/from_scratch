        <p>
          I created a posts folder to start storing posts away from the main page content. I don't like that Jekyll has posts in a directory and pages
          scattered in the root; I'd much rather build a cleaner directory to organize my stuff. I'm also already bored with writing in raw HTML
          format, which I probably could have predicted. ðŸ˜‚ I think my next step is to move to markdown after I've figured out the right way to
          include post html in, say a list of posts. I'm like one step in and it's time to start working on/in Javascript.
