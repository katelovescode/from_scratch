## I'm Going on An Adventure</div>
### June 14th, 2019</div>
This initial post is to outlay the purpose of this project. It's been <em>years</em>> since I built a website from scratch; in the old days I would have done so with raw HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), JS (Javascript) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and uploaded the static files with an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) service directly to a web server.

Over the years, I dabbled with a variety of content-serving/design platforms, the first of which was probably Wordpress (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, HTML, CSS, JS - my first dabbling into database-backed websites). As web development and my career as a software engineer evolved, I learned Ruby, I learned Rails, and I tried static site generators for the tiny little project that is my personal website (that has basically never held more valuable information than my resume). I've usually fallen back on the static-site generator Jekyll and some kind of plain hosting, like Dreamhost or for a while, Github Pages. I've learned quite a lot about app development, API (Application Programming Interface) development, integration, and deployment along over the last several years, and I've still never found Jekyll to serve my needs correctly. I don't mind writing in Markdown necessarily but more often than not I find myself leaning on direct HTML in markdown within Jekyll.

Perhaps because it's been a long time since I've been concerned with (for example) running a server or tinkering with middleware locally, I've started to feel out of touch with some of the fundamentals of building a served website. I've also been interested lately in blogging and having a voice in the community, so rebuilding my site from scratch with a blog series about what I'm doing and how I'm doing it seemed like a prime project to do this. I'm starting with literal raw, unstyled HTML, and building from there. My next step will be serving this raw, unstyled HTML.

Goals and Reasoning:
- I want to regain familiarity with the fundamentals of programming and serving up web sites/apps
- I'd really like to write blog posts about my experience coding and working in the industry
- I'm tired of reading blog posts that don't define terms, even ones it assumes the reader should know, and I'd like to build a "glossary of terms"-type plugin
- I'd like to explore Single Page Architecture
- I want to investigate a variety of servers, templating languages, etc, and decide which I like/choose and write justifications for why
- I want to build a static site generation script of my own and see if I can do it better (or determine why the existing ones are better than what I built)
- I legitimately love version control and this feels like a series of small easy wins that I can build on incrementally, which is fun

This is basically just a pet project for me to noodle around on in my spare time and see what I come up with, and hopefully anyone who reads along at any point will enjoy following the journey. I'm using my <a href="https://github.com/katelovescode/from_scratch/projects/1" target="_blank">GitHub Project</a> on this repo to keep track of TODOs and next steps (though some live in the code currently, I'll need to turn those into actual tickets and prioritize).
