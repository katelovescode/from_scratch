<h2>First Markdown Post</h2>

<h3>July 12th, 2019</h3>

<p>Given my post the other day about already being tired of writing posts in HTML, I decided the next step was to move to Markdown. I&#39;m going to start with the <a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">redcarpet</a> gem, and then iterate if it ends up forcing me to write a lot of raw html in my posts.  Basically my next steps are:
* write a script to parse the Markdown into an HTML document, and save that document to the <code>posts</code> folder
* I&#39;ve been using the same HTML <code>head</code> code on each page so I&#39;ll probably hardcode that into the script for now
* manually add the new post to the homepage list of links</p>

<p>There are definitely some improvements to be made on the next iteration but for <em>now</em> that will deploy the html doc to my site via netlify and it will be served and live.</p>

<p>Workflow for writing posts going forward will be:
* write markdown file (filename should be <code>YYYYMMDDtitle.md</code>)
  * This should include a ## (h2) title and a ### (h3) date at the top
* run script
* merge to <code>master</code> branch (which autodeploys)</p>
